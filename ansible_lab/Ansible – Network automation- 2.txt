First part : Simple Ansible – Network automation- 1

In second part, we progress more and add playbook and explain more :

the below text file is simple example of playbook:

playbook-1.yml :

---
 
- name: playbook-1
  connection: network_cli
  gather_facts: false
  hosts: all
  tasks:
 
    - name: Get config 
      ios_facts:
        gather_subset: all
 
    - name: Display the message
      debug:
        msg: "The  {{ ansible_net_hostname }} has has  {{ ansible_net_iostype }}  platform"

the new command to execute :

ansible-playbook -i 192.168.52.72, -u admin -k -e ansible_network_os=ios playbook-1.yml

As you can see there are some changes in ansible command:

-c : connection moved to playbook >> connection: network_cli
all : moved to playbook >> hosts: all
-m : moved to playbook

the second part of playbook is task 1:

each task has name, module
in this task ansible get device fact but it keep the result in memory and use it in same or other tasks
the purpose this task was just get the fact and dont show it in screen but instead use it in feature .
the module
The third part is task 2:
this task uses info from previous task
debug lets use the variable in message.
